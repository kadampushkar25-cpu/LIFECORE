Contributing to LIFECORE

Thank you for your interest in improving LIFECORE — a safety-critical communication kernel.  
Our priority is security, correctness, and clarity of implementation.

🧠 Principles
1. Security first — no feature outweighs correctness.  
2. Minimalism — small, auditable, dependency-light code.  
3. Deterministic behaviour — avoid undefined or platform-specific quirks.  
4. Privacy by design — no plaintext persists anywhere.
