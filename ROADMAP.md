LIFECORE Roadmap

A forward-looking plan for LIFECORE as it evolves into a full safety infrastructure.

---

🔥 Phase 1 — Core Kernel (Complete)
- Argon2id KDF implementation  
- AEAD encryption with XChaCha20-Poly1305  
- Encrypted logs (logKey wrapping)  
- CLI messenger  
- Utilities: sanitize, rotate keys, decrypt tools  

---

🚀 Phase 2 — Communication Layer
- Encrypted transport via HTTPS POST  
- Server receiver (store + decrypt modes)  
- Multi-endpoint fallback  
- Retry logic + durable message queue  

---

📱 Phase 3 — PWA SOS Agent
- Offline caching  
- Background retry  
- Quick-send UI for emergencies  
- Server public-key discovery  
- Local keypair persistence  

---

🌐 Phase 4 — Distributed Safety Network
- Multi-node redundancy  
- Distributed log replication (encrypted)  
- Zero-trust server mesh  
- Rapid failover router  

---

📡 Phase 5 — Real-time Channels
- WebSocket / QUIC encrypted channels  
- Live location encrypted telemetry  
- High-priority emergency broadcast signaling  

---

🔒 Phase 6 — Security Hardening
- Memory-hard Argon2 profiles  
- Automatic key rotation policies  
- Key aging + expiry notifications  
- Hardened server-side sandbox  

---

🤖 Phase 7 — Intelligence Layer
- Pattern recognition for repeated emergencies  
- Context-aware urgent routing  
- Device-level risk scoring (optional)

---

🌍 Long-Term Vision
LIFECORE becomes the global emergency safety backbone —  
a platform where human distress signals are impossible to lose, fake, or delay.
